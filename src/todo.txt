*Contour lines?

/Heat sources
~Figure out stability issues with fast conduction speeds
*Think about surface area when it comes to drawing grid approximations of objects. diagonal pixels will get twice as much heat transfer if within a reservoir.
*To model convection, instead of setting environment cells of an item's heat grid to the environment temperature every step, we could instead only increment by a factor.
/Need to put some thought into how I can differentiate between conducting between cells of the same component and not (in an efficient way).
      Perhaps I can somehow differentiate between components that should consider temperature differentials within itself and one's that don't to ease calculations for systems that don't need it.
*Implement color lookup table class along with a dynamic generator.
*Currently, the heat transfer coefficient between two surfaces it not considered. It may be possible to add support for this (by manually specifying it) for balance purposes.
*Think about how to determine the size of items. Even though an item's component_grid approximation is 10x10, for example, it doesn't mean that it's real-world size is 10x10 units.
