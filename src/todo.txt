*Contour lines?
*Convection
/Heat sources
*Figure out stability issues with fast conduction speeds
*Think about surface area when it comes to drawing grid approximations of objects. diagonal pixels will get twice as much heat transfer if within a reservoir.
*To model convection, instead of setting environment cells of an item's heat grid to the environment temperature every step, we could instead only increment by a factor.
*Need to put some thought into how I can differentiate between conducting between cells of the same component and not (in an efficient way).
      Perhaps I can somehow differentiate between components that should consider temperature differentials within itself and one's that don't to ease calculations for systems that don't need it.
